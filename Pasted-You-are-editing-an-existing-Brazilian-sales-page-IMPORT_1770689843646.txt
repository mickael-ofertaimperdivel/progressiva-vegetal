You are editing an existing Brazilian sales page.
‎
‎IMPORTANT RULES:
‎- Do NOT rebuild the page.
‎- ONLY move, remove, and reposition images as described.
‎- All visible content MUST remain in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
‎- ZERO BUGS.
‎- Maintain full responsiveness.
‎
‎VERY IMPORTANT IMAGE CORRECTION (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
‎
‎1. HERO SECTION (TOP OF THE PAGE):
‎- In the HERO section (where the page first loads and shows:
‎  - "Pagamento na Entrega"
‎  - Product information
‎  - Main offer
‎):
‎- REMOVE the INCORRECT image that was added there in the last update.
‎- This image must be COMPLETELY REMOVED from the HERO section.
‎
‎2. CORRECT HERO IMAGE:
‎- The SECOND image provided by the user (the main product image that should appear when the page opens) must be:
‎  - The ONLY image displayed in the HERO section.
‎  - Clearly visible when the page loads.
‎- Do NOT place any other images next to it in the HERO section.
‎
‎3. IMAGE WITH "MODO DE USO":
‎- The image that contains the "Modo de Uso do Produto" must NOT appear in the HERO section.
‎- MOVE this image to the SECOND IMAGE AREA / SECOND SECTION of the page.
‎- This section should behave as a FOOTER or LOWER CONTENT area.
‎- The "Modo de Uso" image must be placed together with the other supporting images in this lower section.
‎- This image must be clearly readable, well aligned, and responsive.
‎
‎4. FINAL IMAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):
‎- HERO SECTION (TOP):
‎  - ONLY the correct main product image
‎- LOWER SECTION / FOOTER:
‎  - Image with "Modo de Uso"
‎  - Other complementary images
‎
‎5. FINAL CHECK:
‎- No duplicated images
‎- No wrong images in the HERO section
‎- No layout breaks
‎- Clean visual hierarchy
‎- Strong first impression when opening the page
‎
‎FINAL GOAL:
‎Ensure the correct image appears at the top of the sales page, remove the wrong image from the HERO section, and place the "Modo de Uso" image only in the lower section — creating clarity, professionalism, and zero confusion for the customer.
