You are editing an existing Brazilian sales page that is already built.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT rebuild the page from scratch.
- ONLY edit and fix existing elements.
- All visible texts on the website MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
- The page must have NO BUGS.
- Ensure perfect responsiveness on mobile and desktop.
- Keep a clean, professional, high-conversion layout.

REQUESTED EDITS (FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1. MAIN TOP HEADLINE (VERY IMPORTANT):
- At the very top of the page, where the product name "Progressiva Vegetal" is currently displayed:
  - REPLACE this text with:
    "PAGAMENTO NA ENTREGA"
- This headline must be:
  - VERY LARGE
  - BOLD
  - RED COLOR
  - The most visible element on the page
- This is the main hook of the page.

2. SECONDARY HEADLINE / SECOND BANNER:
- In the second highlighted message or second notice where it currently says "Pagamento na Entrega":
  - CHANGE the text to:
    "Progressiva Vegetal"
- Make "Progressiva Vegetal":
  - Large
  - Bold
  - Highly visible
- This should appear right at the beginning of the page, just below the main red headline.

3. TEXT HIERARCHY (TOP OF PAGE):
- Ensure the visual hierarchy is:
  1. PAGAMENTO NA ENTREGA (red, very large)
  2. Progressiva Vegetal (product name, very visible)
- This hierarchy must be clear immediately when the page loads.

4. BUY BUTTON FIX (CRITICAL BUG FIX):
- The buy button at the bottom of the page currently has sizing and click issues.
- FIX the button so that:
  - It fits perfectly inside its container
  - The text does NOT overflow
  - The entire button is clickable
- KEEP the button color as GOLD.
- Align the text properly inside the gold button.
- Make sure the button looks standard, clean, and professional.
- Ensure full responsiveness on mobile.

5. BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES SECTION:
- ADD a new section titled in Portuguese:
  "Antes e Depois do Resultado da Progressiva"
- This section must:
  - Support multiple images
  - Use image placeholders
  - Be responsive (grid or gallery layout)
- The user will manually replace the images later.
- Emphasize visible transformation and results.

6. FINAL QUALITY CHECK:
- No layout breaks
- No visual bugs
- No overlapping elements
- Consistent spacing, fonts, and colors
- Strong focus on conversion and clarity

FINAL GOAL:
Improve clarity, visual hierarchy, and professionalism of the sales page while keeping the entire content in Brazilian Portuguese and emphasizing "Pagamento na Entrega" as the main offer.
