You are editing an existing Brazilian sales page.
‎
‎IMPORTANT RULES:
‎- Do NOT rebuild or redesign the page.
‎- ONLY fix the button behavior, performance issues, and any bugs.
‎- All visible content MUST remain in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
‎- The page must be FAST, SMOOTH, and WITHOUT BUGS.
‎- Maintain full responsiveness (mobile and desktop).
‎
‎CORRECT BUTTON PERFORMANCE AND BUGS (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
‎
‎1. FIX BUTTON CLICK BEHAVIOR:
‎- There is a performance issue when clicking the “Pagamento na Entrega” button.
‎- Inspect the button click action and ensure:
‎  - It does NOT cause delays or long loading times.
‎  - It immediately directs the user to the correct Logzz payment link.
‎  - No unnecessary scripts or slow redirects are triggered.
‎
‎2. REMOVE ANY BLOCKING FEATURES:
‎- If any JavaScript functions, animations, or unnecessary loading scripts are delaying the button:
‎  - Remove or optimize them.
‎- The button should work with a minimal, direct action.
‎- Ensure no long waits or page freezes.
‎
‎3. LINK CONFIRMATION:
‎- Confirm that the correct link is assigned to the button:
‎  https://entrega.logzz.com.br/pay/mem0gg6x4/progcreme150
‎- Ensure the link opens fast (no intermediate steps, no lag).
‎
‎4. BUTTON LOADING / UI RESPONSE:
‎- If desired, add a lightweight visual response (e.g., a short color change or quick feedback) when clicked.
‎- This response must be subtle and not delay navigation.
‎
‎5. VERIFY PERFORMANCE:
‎- Test button on mobile and desktop view.
‎- It must respond instantly or within acceptable milliseconds.
‎- Ensure no console errors, no broken navigation, no redirects.
‎
‎6. FINAL QA:
‎- No layout breaks after corrections.
‎- All versions of the button on the page must behave consistently.
‎- All text stays in Brazilian Portuguese.
‎- The page must remain clean, professional, and high-conversion.
‎
‎FINAL GOAL:
‎Fix the button performance issues so that clicking any “Pagamento na Entrega” button is fast, direct, and bug-free, while keeping the sales page exactly as it currently is, in Brazilian Portuguese, and responsive.
