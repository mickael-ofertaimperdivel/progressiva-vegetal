You are a senior full-stack developer, conversion-focused copywriter, and UX/UI designer.

Your task is to build a HIGH-CONVERTING SALES PAGE (landing page) for a Brazilian product: a "Progressiva Vegetal" (plant-based hair straightening treatment).

IMPORTANT RULES:
- The entire website content (texts, buttons, copy, headlines) MUST be written in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
- The code, structure, and logic can be in English, but the visible content must be in Portuguese.
- The page must be FAST, RESPONSIVE (mobile-first), clean, modern, and with NO BUGS.
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no backend needed).
- Optimize for conversion above everything.

MAIN OFFER FOCUS:
The core and repeated offer of the page MUST be:
👉 "PAGUE SÓ NA ENTREGA"
👉 "Você só paga quando o produto chegar na sua casa"
👉 "Sem pagamento antecipado"
👉 "Entrega para todo o Brasil"

This message must be VERY EXPLICIT and repeated multiple times across the page.

PAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):

1. TOP SECTION (Above the Fold):
- Big, bold headline with strong emphasis on:
  "PAGUE SÓ NA ENTREGA"
- Subheadline reinforcing:
  "Você só paga quando o produto chegar na sua casa"
- Visual badge or highlight saying:
  "Pagamento na Entrega • 100% Seguro • Todo o Brasil"
- Primary CTA button:
  "COMPRAR AGORA – PAGAR SÓ NA ENTREGA"

2. PRODUCT IMAGES:
- Display high-quality product images (use placeholders if needed).
- Include image gallery or product mockups.
- Images should be visually appealing and professional.

3. STRONG SALES COPY (Persuasive Copywriting):
- Write an irresistible sales copy in Brazilian Portuguese.
- Focus on:
  - Benefits of the progressiva vegetal
  - Smooth, straight, shiny hair
  - No damage, no harsh chemicals
  - Suitable for all hair types
  - Professional results at home
- Use emotional triggers, desire, transformation, and social proof language.

4. PAYMENT ON DELIVERY EXPLANATION (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Dedicated section explaining clearly:
  - The customer DOES NOT pay anything online
  - Payment is made ONLY when the product arrives
  - The delivery person brings the product and collects payment
  - Available for all regions of Brazil
- Reinforce trust and security.

5. TRUST & SECURITY SECTION:

  - 100% Seguro

7. CALL TO ACTION (MULTIPLE TIMES):
- Multiple CTA buttons throughout the page:
  - "QUERO PAGAR SÓ NA ENTREGA"
  - "COMPRAR AGORA – PAGAMENTO NA ENTREGA"
- Buttons should scroll or simulate checkout intent.

8. FINAL URGENCY SECTION:
- Scarcity and urgency copy:
  - "Oferta por tempo limitado"
  - "Estoque limitado"
  - "Aproveite enquanto ainda pode pagar só na entrega"

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, modern Brazilian e-commerce style
- Use colors that convey beauty, trust, and professionalism
